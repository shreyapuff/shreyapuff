### 🌷 Hello, I'm Shreya!

I'm a frontend designer-developer who builds thoughtful UIs with emotion, structure, and accessibility in mind. I combine semantic HTML, CSS custom properties, and modular JavaScript to create experiences that are both technically sound and emotionally resonant.

I believe good design is:
- 🧠 Built from semantic scaffolding  
- 🌗 Fully theme-aware and motion-respectful  
- ✨ Carefully animated to guide, not distract  
- ♿ Accessible, inclusive, and responsive from the start  

My work blends soft visuals with sharp logic — not because it looks good, but because it *feels right to use.*

---

### 🧠 What I’ve Learned by Building

- **CSS is a design system tool**: I use BEM, custom props, and `data-theme` toggles to build adaptable UI themes with minimal overhead.

- **Accessibility isn’t optional**: From keyboard flow to dark mode legibility, I treat inclusivity as a foundational constraint — not a bonus.

- **Animation should support clarity**: Keyframes and the Web Animations API help express meaning, but motion preferences always come first.

- **State is UX**: I link localStorage logic, UI feedback, and microinteractions so that interface behavior reflects emotional flow and clarity.

- **Tone isn’t fluff**: Interface emotion — whether in theme, interaction, or feedback — is a layer of trust that I design with purpose.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Area | Tools + Techniques |
|------|---------------------|
| **Languages** | HTML5 (semantic), CSS3 (BEM + custom props), Vanilla JS (ES6 modules, IIFE) |
| **Design** | Figma (component systems), emoji-based themes, pastel accessibility |
| **UX Logic** | `data-theme` toggling, reduced-motion fallbacks, localStorage state |
| **Deployment** | GitHub Pages, PWA manifests, responsive layout testing |
| **Animation** | CSS keyframes, Web Animations API, inclusive motion patterns |
| **Accessibility** | Semantic markup, accessible SVGs (`<title>` + `<desc>`), keyboard flow |

### 🧁 Selected Projects

Projects where I applied structure + softness with real impact:

- 🐰 **[To-Do Soft](https://github.com/shreyapuff/todosoft)**  
  A cozy PWA task manager with mascot UX, streak logic, pastel theming, and dark mode toggle. Fully accessible, with motion fallbacks and onboarding.

- 🌦️ **[One Weather Piece](https://github.com/shreyapuff/oneweatherpiece)**  
  Real-time weather app with live API feedback, animated states, and One Piece–themed UI. Emphasizes clarity in visual + data transitions.

- 🖼️ **[Personal Portfolio](https://github.com/shreyapuff/mywebsite)**  
  Bloomcore-coded site built with semantic HTML, expressive animations, soft visuals, and a sparkle trail. Focused on what I learned, not just what I built.

> ✧ Bonus: I also explored ambient UX through [Bloomly](https://github.com/shreyapuff/bloomly), an offline-first mood garden with tone-coded interactions.

### ✨ Design Philosophy

> *Clarity is cute. Delight is essential. Good code is conversation.*

The deeper I’ve gone into frontend, the more I believe that interfaces are emotional spaces. I design and code with softness not as an aesthetic — but as a structure that supports trust, attention, and care.

### 📚 Currently Exploring

- ✿ Theming token systems for consistent pastel palettes  
- ✿ Progressive enhancement and graceful JS fallbacks  
- ✿ Calm UI principles for motion-reduced preferences  
- ✿ Framework-free UX logic using native JS

### 🤝 Let’s Collaborate

I’m currently looking for:
- 💼 Frontend internships or research-driven UI roles  
- 🧪 Collabs that blend design and logic for human-first tools  
- 🧁 Side projects focused on emotional UX, accessibility, and clarity

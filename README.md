### 🌼 How I Build

- ♿ Accessibility-first: semantic HTML5, ARIA-aware SVGs, and color/contrast sanity from day one  
- 🎨 CSS that scales: custom props, BEM-based modules, and emoji-driven theme toggles  
- 🧠 Zero frameworks: vanilla JS with ES6 modules, IIFE patterns, and progressive enhancement  
- 🕊️ Motion with meaning: CSS keyframes + Web Animations API, always `prefers-reduced-motion` friendly  
- 💾 Offline-friendly UX: LocalStorage state, PWA manifest, and clean GitHub Pages delivery

### ✨ Projects I Loved Making

#### 🐰 [To-Do Soft](https://shreyapuff.github.io/todosoft)  
A pastel to-do list that rewards consistency with animated streaks and bunny cheerleaders. Every feature — from data persistence to theme switching — is hand-built with modular JS and CSS. The mascot even reacts to how well you're doing.

#### 🌦️ [One Weather Piece](https://shreyapuff.github.io/oneweatherpiece)  
A weather dashboard that responds *emotionally* to real-time forecasts — cloudy days get calmer tones, stormy ones get a bold glow. I focused on API clarity, motion subtlety, and responsive behavior that respects space and scroll.

#### 🌱 [Bloomly](https://shreyapuff.github.io/bloomly)  
Offline mood-logging app designed to reflect your state through soft UI changes and ambient animations. Built without any third-party libraries to explore how far vanilla JS and CSS can go when tuned carefully.

### 🧶 What I’m Exploring Right Now

- Designing themes that express emotion beyond color inversion 🎭  
- Creating onboarding flows that *don’t feel like onboarding*  
- Refining my offline-first PWA patterns  
- Writing cleaner, friendlier JS APIs for UI interactions

### 🌸 About Me

I’m a frontend designer-developer who codes for clarity and emotion. Through building tools with animation, theming, and interaction design, I’ve learned that frontend isn’t just about layout — it’s about how something feels when you use it.

I believe good design is:
- 💖 Emotionally responsive  
- 🌿 Built from semantics and accessibility first  
- 🎐 Carefully animated and fully theme-aware  
- 🌗 Structured in code as thoughtfully as it is in visuals

Every interface I build now reflects those principles — not because I read them in a book, but because I hit the edge cases, broke things, and kept redesigning until it felt right.

---

### ✨ What I’ve Learned

- **Design systems start in code**, not just Figma: I use CSS variables, component conventions (BEM), and structured JS modules to make UIs that scale and shift with ease.

- **Accessibility is the baseline**, not the bonus: From dark mode readability to keyboard flow, I’ve learned how to bake inclusivity into every layout.

- **Animation should guide, not distract**: I’ve built with both keyframes and GSAP, and now always respect motion preferences. Animation exists to support understanding.

- **State is a UX decision**: Whether handling API feedback or tracking streaks, I’ve learned to connect logic with emotion — so systems feel calm, clear, and helpful.

- **Emotion isn’t fluff**: A mascot, a microinteraction, a pastel gradient — they aren’t extras. They’re interface tone. I now code them intentionally.

**Workflow Highlights:**
- Modular JS (ES6 classes, IIFE patterns)  
- `data-theme` toggling with custom CSS props  
- Semantic HTML5 and accessible SVGs  
- PWA manifests and localStorage logic  
- Web Animations API + `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)`

### 🧁 Selected Projects

A few tools where I applied these ideas:

| Project Name | Type |
|--------------|------|
| [`To-Do Soft`](https://github.com/shreyapuff/todo-soft) | Interactive task manager with mascot UX and dark mode logic |
| [`One Weather Piece`](https://github.com/shreyapuff/one-weather-piece) | Data-driven themed weather UI with real-time feedback |
| [`mywebsite`](https://github.com/shreyapuff/mywebsite) | Personal portfolio with bloomcore animation + semantic structure |

> ✧ Bonus: I also explored gentle, offline-first UX through [Bloomly](https://github.com/shreyapuff/bloomly), a pastel-coded mood garden.

### 💭 Philosophy

> ✧ *Clarity is cute.*  
> ✧ *Delight isn’t extra — it’s essential.*  
> ✧ *Good code should read like thoughtful conversation.*

Soft doesn’t mean unserious. The more I’ve built, the more I believe in interfaces that balance aesthetic charm with structural care — the kind that professors trust and recruiters remember.

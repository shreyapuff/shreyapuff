### 🌷 Hello, I'm Shreya!

I'm a frontend developer who blends **semantic HTML**, **pastel design systems**, and **gentle microinteractions** to build sites that are both accessible and expressive. I care deeply about making the web feel calmer — especially for motion-sensitive users and anyone tired of over-engineered UIs.

Whether it’s a productivity bunny or a theme-switching garden, my projects explore how small details can create big emotional impact 🐇🌱

---

### 🛠️ How I Build Soft UIs

- ♿ **Accessibility-first**  
  Every SVG gets a `<title>` and keyboard nav is tested from the start.

- 🌗 **Custom theming systems**  
  I build emoji toggles powered by `data-theme` attributes — with dark/light modes that *feel* different, not just look different.

- 🎞️ **Meaningful motion**  
  I use CSS keyframes and Web Animations API to teach interaction — always checking for `prefers-reduced-motion`.

- 📦 **Offline-first logic**  
  With PWA manifest support and LocalStorage state, everything works even when the WiFi doesn’t.

- 📐 **No frameworks, just fundamentals**  
  Vanilla JS (ES6 modules + IIFE), modular CSS (BEM), and progressive enhancement lead my workflow.

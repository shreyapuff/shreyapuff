### ✳️ About Me

Hi, I’m Shreya — a frontend developer who builds interfaces with semantic HTML, purposeful motion, and framework-free logic. My work is shaped by accessibility principles, clean structure, and an attention to user experience that prioritizes clarity over clutter.

I focus on the details that make interfaces *feel right* — from emoji-driven theming to animation that communicates intent, not distraction.

---

### 🛠 Core Skills

- ✅ Semantic HTML5 with accessibility baked in from the start
- ✅ Modular CSS (BEM), CSS custom props, and responsive layouts
- ✅ Theme systems using emoji toggles and `data-theme` switching
- ✅ Motion with intent — CSS keyframes and Web Animations API with `prefers-reduced-motion` fallbacks
- ✅ Vanilla JS architecture — ES6 modules, IIFE patterns, and zero-framework delivery
- ✅ LocalStorage state management and PWA manifest support
